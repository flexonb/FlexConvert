## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your browser updated
- Use the latest version of FlexConvert
- Be cautious with files from untrusted sources
- Report suspicious behavior

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Regular dependency updates
- Code reviews for security

## Known Security Considerations

### Browser-Based Processing
- **Memory Limits**: Large files may cause browser crashes
- **JavaScript Security**: All processing runs in browser sandbox
- **File Validation**: We validate file types but can't prevent all malicious content

### Dependencies
- We regularly update all dependencies
- Security patches are applied promptly
- We monitor vulnerability databases

### Sharing Features (Optional)
- File sharing is optional and clearly marked
- Shared files have expiration dates
- No personal data is required for sharing
- Users control what they share

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the severity and impact
   - Implement emergency fixes if needed
   - Notify affected users

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine root cause
   - Assess data exposure (minimal due to client-side processing)
   - Document timeline and impact

3. **Communication**
   - Transparent communication with users
   - Regular updates during incident response
   - Post-incident report

4. **Recovery**
   - Deploy fixes
   - Monitor for additional issues
   - Update security measures

## Security Updates
